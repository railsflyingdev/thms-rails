# XKCD Password Generator 0.2.6 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fardog/node-xkcd-password.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fardog/node-xkcd-password)

Creates an [XKCD-style password](http://xkcd.com/936/) based on your parameters. Includes a CLI (`xkcd-password`) for your convenience, and a default wordlist.

> **Warning:** I am not a cryptographer, or any sort of password expert. An audit would be greatly appreciated.

## Installation

To install the module for use in your projects:

```
npm install xkcd-password
```

Or a global install to get the commandline client:

```
npm install xkcd-password -g
```

This will make the `xkcd-password` command available on your path.

## Usage

This can be used both as a module in another application, or when installed 
globally, via a commandline application.

### CLI

```
$ xkcd-password --help

Usage: xkcd-password [options]

Options:
   -n, --numWords    The number of words to generate for your password.  [4]
   -m, --minLength   Minimum lengh of words chosen for the generated password.  [5]
   -x, --maxLength   Maximum length of words chosen for the generated password.  [8]
   -f, --wordFile    The newline-delimited list of words to be used as the source.
   -s, --separator   The separator character to use between words when output to the console.  [ ]
   --version         print version and exit
```

### Module

```js
var xkcdPassword = require('xkcd-password');
var pw = new xkcdPassword();

var options = {
    numWords: 4,
    minLength: 5,
    maxLength: 8
};

pw.generate(options, function(err, result) {
    console.log(result); // ['distome', 'pantries', 'sending', 'weiner']
});
```

## Environment Variables

Internally, we use [random-lib][randomlib] for our random number generator, which uses the following environment variables:

- **RAND_ALLOW_PRNG**
Set this environment variable to allow fallback to Node's `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes()` function if we fail to get entropy from `crypto.randomBytes()`. This decreases the quality of the random numbers, but will stop us from throwing an error.

- **RAND_BUFFER_SIZE**
How many bytes of entropy we create in a single go. Internally, we create a buffer of entropy and then use it until it's exhausted, then refill the buffer. A small buffer exhausts more quickly, but generates faster and uses less memory. Default is 512 bytes. This value cannot be less than 256 bytes.

## Known Bugs

- Trying to generate more a large number of words in a single `generate()` call may overflow the call stack. You'll usually be fine up to 2500 words though so it's not much of a problem.
- Due to an oddity in how [nomnom][nomnom] handles certain characters, you need to use the long form of the separator option when using some characters on the command line, e.g. `xkcd-password --separator='-'` for dash separators.

## Contributing

Feel free to send pull requests! I'm not picky, but would like the following:

1. Write tests for any new features, and do not break existing tests.
2. Be sure to point out any changes that break API.

## History

- **v0.2.6**  
Updates to the latest version of [async][async], so that xkcd-password and [random-lib][randomlib] use the same version.

- **v0.2.5**  
Additional tests.

- **v0.2.4**  
Avoids [releasing Zalgo](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony) on errors.

- **v0.2.3**  
Smarter rewrite of word generation function based on additional functionality that [random-lib][randomlib] provides. Additional tests.

- **v0.2.2**  
Now uses my [random-lib][randomlib] wrapper for `crypto.randomBytes()`.

- **v0.2.1**  
Now uses Node's `crypto.randomBytes()` for its PRNG, rather than Math.random() in most cases.

- **v0.2.0**  
Changes generation function to accept an "options" object rather than discrete parameters to the generate function. Provides defaults if options aren't given.
