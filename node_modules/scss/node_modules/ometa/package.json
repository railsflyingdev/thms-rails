Questions\nabout the core should be directed to the original author, Alessandro\nWarth.\n\n## Original README\n\nThe following files contain some important info:\n\n* Not_Quite_JS.txt explains the difference between \"real\" JavaScript and\n  the JavaScript that can be used in the OMeta/JS Workspace.\n\n* Things_You_Should_Know.txt explains the differences between the original\n  OMeta syntax (as it appeared in the DLS'07 paper) and the newer OMeta/js\n  syntax.\n\n* OMeta_Tutorial.txt contains a bunch of examples that show how OMeta\n  can be used for pattern matching, parsing, etc.\n\nAnother good resource for OMeta programmers is the OMeta mailing list.
